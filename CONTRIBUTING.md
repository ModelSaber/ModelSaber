### Guidelines ModelSaber.Main
  * Breaking changes have to be reasoned in a way meaningful conversation can be held.
  * Frontend styling has to be consistent with the rest of the page(s).
  * Make sure tests have been done, **IN DEVELOPMENT,** that way we don't have to fix **your** bugs.
  
### Guidelines ModelSaber.API
  * Breaking changes have to be reasoned in a way meaningful conversation can be held.
    * Should breaking changes to the API happen, these changes **WILL NOT** be built for production, and will rather be put on dev until a warning has been issued. 
      These builds will typically only be used to make changes in existing tooling, like ModelDownloader, or QuestModelDownloader.
  * Make sure tests have been done, **IN DEVELOPMENT,** that way we don't have to fix **your** bugs.
